From v11, it is now possible to copy and paste multi records into child table field in the form, simply follow the steps below
1. Prepare the source data in Excel or text editor with each column separated by tab
2. drag to select the records , and click the copy menu button or by ctrl + C
     case 1. first line as column header, both field name and label supported, hidden columns can be copied
     case 2. no column header, the data will directly map to the visible columns
3. Place the cursor to the target input field of the child table, paste it by ctrl + V
   unlike the import via upload file feature which also can batch input the child table, this copy & paste feature will trigger field
   change event automatically, in other word if only item_code is pasted, the item price, qty and other item code related fields will 
   be auto populated just like user manually input item code and press ENTER. on the other hand, for performance consideration, less
   than 100 records per paste is allowed.
